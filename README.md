# European Option Pricing
Part of INDENG 221 - Introduction to Financial Engineering at UC Berkeley, this project applies Monte Carlo simulations to price a European call option. We evaluate three estimators— Plain Monte Carlo, Antithetic Variate, and Control Variate — comparing them to the Black-Scholes formula. Results include price estimates and associated error values for each method.
